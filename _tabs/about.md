> Hello, Good to see you here, My name is `Dennis Masila - D_captain`.
{: .prompt-tip }

I am a cyber security enthusiast. A CTF player [**@Fr334aks-mini**](https://twitter.com/fr334aksmini)
: A lover of identifying security vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks before they are exploited by malicious attackers. 


My aim is to deliver high-quality security assessments that help clients improve their security posture and protect their sensitive data. 
I am dedicated to providing the highest level of security assurance.


Why did the penetration tester refuse to go to the beach? Because he heard there was too much phishing going on!

There are many ways of killing a rat!
