Hello there, over the Weekend we - [Fr334aks-mini](https://www.linkedin.com/company/83010158/) got a chance to play University of Toronto CTF and emerged at the 377th place.

UofTCTF 2025 was a jeopardy-style CTF that run from Sat, 11 Jan. 2025, 03:00 EAT — Mon, 13 Jan. 2025, 03:00 EAT. It was organized by the [UofTCTF team](https://ctftime.org/team/139261), [Dataflow security](https://dfsec.com/) and [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io/), with classic categories like web, pwn, crypto, rev, forensics, and misc. 

Let’s look at one of the challenges we solved: this was particularly in the "Miscellaneous" category.

## Math Test

Looking at the given server, we are greeted with some easy math questions that I noticed I would spend the whole day solving.

Let's find what we have in the zip.
We are given a zip file that upon extracting we get this python file.

```python
import random
from flag import FLAG

def genRandMath():
    eqn = f'{random.randint(-1000, 1000)}'
    eqn = f"{eqn} {random.choice(['+', '*', '-', '//'])} {random.randint(-1000, 1000)}"
    while random.randint(0, 3) != 1:
        eqn = f"{eqn} {random.choice(['+', '*', '-', '//'])} {random.randint(-1000, 1000)}"
    try:
        res = eval(eqn)
        return eqn, res
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return genRandMath()

print("Welcome to a simple math test.")
print("If you solve these basic math questions, I will give you the flag.")
print("Good Luck")

for i in range(1000):
    eqn, correct = genRandMath()
    print(f"Question: {eqn}")
    res = int(input("Answer: "))
    if res != correct:
        print(f"Wrong!! Correct answer is {correct}")
        exit()
    
    print(f"Correct {i+1}/1000")

print(f"Congratz! Here is the flag {FLAG}")
```


### Code analysis
The script presents an interesting math challenge where a user must correctly solve 1,000 randomly generated math problems to receive the flag (stored FLAG variable in another module).

Key Features:

: Each problem is randomly unique, making it difficult to predict or automate.
: The script provides instant feedback on whether the user's answer is correct or not.
: Users must solve all 1,000 questions correctly without a single mistake to get a flag.

The challenges:

: There is a high likelihood of incorrectly solving over 1,000 questions with a single shot each.
: I couldn't find a way to view the FLAG without answering all questions correctly.

### Solution

The questions were easy but the only way to do it swiftly is auto-ing the process.

I made a script that read the questions, computed the answers, and send them back to the server.

```python
# Author: D_C4ptain

import socket

def Mtest(ip, port):
    # Connect to server
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((ip, port))
        print(f"Connected to {ip}:{port}")

        # Receive from server
        while True:
            data = s.recv(1024).decode()  
            if not data:
                break
            print(data) 

            # Check for question
            if "Question:" in data:
                # Extract math challenge
                try:
                    question = data.split("Question:")[1].split("\n")[0].strip()
                    # Solve math
                    answer = eval(question)
                except (ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, SyntaxError) as e:
                    print(f"Error processing question: {e}")
                    answer = 0 

                # Send the answer back
                s.sendall(f"{answer}\n".encode())
            elif "Congratz!" in data or "flag" in data:
                # Print flag and exit
                print(data)
                break

Mtest("34.66.235.106", 5000)
```
Running this:

This took a few minutes but totally worth it.

![mt4.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/uoftctf25/mt4.png)

```
uoftctf{7h15_15_b451c_10_7357_d16u153d_45_4_m47h_7357}
```

See you in another CTF!

And remember, there are many ways of killing Jerry!
