On Fri, 08 Nov. 2024 my team- Fr334aks-mini participated in Bluehens CTF 2024 - a jeopardy-style Capture The Flag (CTF) competition organized by the University of Delaware's own [CTF team](https://ctftime.org/team/64660) in collaboration with BSides Delaware. 

Fr334aks-mini secured position 223 out of 498 teams globally, reflecting our growing experience and commitment to learning in this competitive arena. The challenges were diverse and well-crafted, covering a range of categories that pushed us to think critically.

In this write-up, I will share some insights from the competition. Each challenge, regardless of its difficulty, contributed to our growth and has motivated us to aim even higher in future competitions.

## **OSINT**
### **Training Problem: Intro to OSINT**

![osint1a.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/bluehensctf24/osint1a.png)

We are given an image “osint1.png” and a description

A famous person is selling their house. In this market, who wouldn't? Can you tell me who owns this house, and what the license plate of their "tough" car is? 

Flag format: udctf{FirstLast_licenseplate}

Doing reverse image search in google we find several instances of the image

Seems someone is truly tired of his house. Let’s find out who?

Checking out the image link, we have some specifics.

Let’s take a look at that address, and sure we have a name!

Looking around for his car, He really likes cars

I landed into this page with a short video

We now have a fully built tough flag

`udctf{MarcEcko_WLJ-80F}`

## **Forensics**
### a. **Inner Demons**

![image.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/bluehensctf24/image%201.png)

We are given an image with the description - I can’t seem to sleep at night… Maybe I need to dig further within.

Suspecting steganography, I used **StegSeek**, a powerful tool for uncovering hidden content in JPEG files, to analyze the image.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Running StegSeek:**
    
    I executed the following command:
    
    ```bash
    stegseek inner_demons.jpg
    
    ```
    
    StegSeek scanned the file for steganographic content embedded with a passphrase.
    
2. **Tool Output:**
    
    The tool successfully identified a hidden file using the passphrase `junji`. The hidden data was in a file named `flag.txt` originally. It extracted the concealed content and saved it to `inner_demons.jpg.out`
    
3. **Reading the Extracted Content:**
    
    I inspected the output file with:
    
    ```bash
    cat inner_demons.jpg.out
    
    ```
    
    This revealed the flag:
    
    `udctf{h0w_d0_y0u_s133p_@t_n1ght?}`
    

### b. **Whispers of the Feathered Messenger**

This challenge required unraveling multiple layers of hidden data to uncover the flag. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of my solution:

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Identifying the File Type:**
    
    I began by inspecting the file provided using the `file` command:
    
    ```bash
    file bird.jpeg
    
    ```
    
2. **Extracting Metadata:**
    
    To explore hidden information, I ran `exiftool` on the image:
    
    ```bash
    exiftool bird.jpeg
    
    ```
    
    The output included a comment field containing this cool string:
    
    ```
    Comment: UGFzc3dvcmQ6IDVCNEA3cTchckVc
    
    ```
    
3. **Decoding the Comment:**
    
    Suspecting Base64 encoding, I decoded the string using:
    

![blh2.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/bluehensctf24/blh2.png)

 This revealed a password:

```
5B4@7q7!rE\

```

1. **Using Steghide:**
    
    With the password in hand, I utilized `steghide` to extract hidden data from the image:
    
    ```bash
    steghide extract -sf bird.jpeg -p '5B4@7q7!rE\'
    
    ```
    
    This produced a file named `encrypted_flag.bin`.
    
2. **Analyzing the Extracted File:**
    
    Running the `file` command on `encrypted_flag.bin` identified it as an OpenSSL-encrypted file.
    
3. **Decrypting with OpenSSL:**
    
    Referring to [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056135/how-to-use-openssl-to-encrypt-decrypt-files), I decrypted the file using:
    
    ```bash
    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in encrypted_flag.bin -out decrypted_flag -pass pass:'5B4@7q7!rE\'
    
    ```
    
4. **Retrieving the Flag:**
    
    Viewing the decrypted output revealed the flag:
    
    `UDCTF{m0AybE_YoR3$!_a_f0recnicsEs_3xpEr^t}`
    

## **XOR**

### **XS1: XOR without XOR**

![image.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/bluehensctf24/image%204.png)

The title hinted at solving the problem "without XOR," suggesting the need to explore alternative methods beyond brute force or direct XOR operations.

Looking at the nature of the problem image and the hint in the title, I believed that the string had been manipulated in a reversible manner, possibly by reversing and slicing.

I made a python script to reverse the reversed flag

Running her:

`udctf{just_4_b4by_1ntr0_pr0bl3m}`

Big thanks to my team mates. Till next time, cheers!

And remember, there are many ways of killing a rat!
