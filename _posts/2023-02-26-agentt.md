Something seems a little off with the server.

Agent T uncovered this website, which looks innocent enough, but something seems off about how the server responds…
[Room here](https://tryhackme.com/room/agentt)

## Enumeration

    nmap -sV 10.10.146.43 -Pn -v

Checking the web server:

Found nothing of interest on the website.
Directory fuzzing wasn’t helpful.

Checking with whatweb for site libraries and dependency versions:

    whatweb http://10.10.146.43/ -v

Seeing the php version, I checked out on [exploit db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933) and found it’s susceptible to an RCE through the user agent.

## Getting that shell

Running the exploit, we get a root shell.
No privilege escalation today!

Let’s find that flag.
Found nothing on root and home directories.

Using find:

    find / -type f -name *.txt 2>/dev/null

There we go, kill that ratty flag!
