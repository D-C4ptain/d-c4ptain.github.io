As part of our engagement in the [P3rf3ctr00t](https://perfectroot.wiki/) CTF, [Fr334aks-mini](https://www.linkedin.com/company/83010158/) showcased remarkable teamwork and determination, achieving 5th place overall, while our second team secured 26th position. This competition presented diverse challenges that tested our problem-solving skills across multiple domains, sharpening our technical expertise and teamwork.

In this write-up, I will delve into some of the challenges I tackled in OSINT, Reverse Engineering, Forensics, and Steganography. These categories not only highlight the breadth of the competition but also underline the strategic approaches and methodologies I employed to solve them. Each challenge provided unique insights and opportunities for growth, contributing to our overall success.

Let’s explore the challenges and my journey through these fascinating categories.

## OSINT
### Adversary Within - Part 1

![oaw1.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/oaw1.png)

From the description, this was definitely referring to Active Directory. 

**“…roasts”** This hinted on kerberoasting. Kerberoasting is a technique that exploits Kerberos authentication protocol where a threat actor steals Kerberos service tickets to uncover the plaintext passwords of network service accounts. 

At first I thought of ACLs but then looking around with a team mate([jnmunene](https://jnmunene.com/)) I got hold of “schema” that defines all the objects and attributes that the directory service uses to store data as per Microsoft.

`r00t{schema}`

## Steg
### Mayday Mayday

We are given a .wav file. What came into my mind was morse code for some reason(may be it’s the description).

Using [this site](https://morsefm.com/) I got the flag quite easily.

(had to use this in Chromium browser - Firefox probably doesn’t like morse)

## Forensics
### Code Mirage

![fcode.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/fcode.png)

Just a heads up, I **blooded** this challenge! 

I found it quite easy since I had done something similar at Huntress CTF 2023.

Check it out here [HuntressCTF 2023 writeup](https://d-c4ptain.github.io/posts/HuntressCTF-2023-writeup/)

I will not go much into this but here is a breakdown of what is happening.

We are given a file with PHP code and some strings. (snippet looked a bit frivolous)

```php
<?php
$L66Rgr = explode(base64_decode("Pz4="), file_get_contents(__FILE__));
$L6CRgr = array(
    base64_decode("L3gvaQ=="),
    base64_decode("eA=="),
    base64_decode(strrev(str_rot47(base64_decode($L66Rgr[1]))))
);
$L7CRgr = "d6d666e70e43a3aeaec1be01341d9f9d";
preg_replace($L6CRgr[0], serialize(eval($L6CRgr[2])), $L6CRgr[1]);
exit();
?>

```

### Step 1: Decoding Key Elements

- The `explode()` function separates the content of the PHP file based on the delimiter `?>`, derived from decoding `Pz4=` using Base64. This effectively splits the script into two parts: the code before and after `?>`.
- Several strings were decoded using `base64_decode()`, revealing:
    - `L3gvaQ==` translates to `/x/i`, a regular expression pattern.
    - `eA==` translates to `x`, a string used in pattern matching.
- The second part of the split content (after `?>`) undergoes multiple transformations:
    1. Decoded from Base64.
    2. Passed through a ROT47 cipher.
    3. Reversed using `strrev()`.

### Step 2: Leveraging CyberChef

To decode the extracted and transformed string, I used **CyberChef** with the following recipe:

1. Reverse the string.
2. Apply ROT47.
3. Decode the result from Base64.

```php
r00t{8f93d0a6b7c8d90e4f7a1b9e6c3d4f8e9a2d0f3c5e7b8c6d1f3a5b9c4d2}
```

### Pores

![rpores.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/rpores.png)

Just started learning reverse engineering so, I may not know what I am doing but I am good at it.

Looking at the file type revealed that it was an unstripped(has debug information) elf

![poreshot3.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/poreshot3.png)

I then checked out for any readable strings within the file with the strings command

![poreshot4.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/poreshot4.png)

Making the file executable with `chmod +x poresssss` then running it `./poresssss` gave no output. 

What just happened! Ever downloaded a random game online and installed it locally. While playing you get to see random pop ups that disappear in a sec? that’s what it feels running a binary and there’s no nothing.

### Ghidra’s take:

The main functions is empty and does not seem to call any other function, especially the printFlag function which is why we are here in the first place!

![poreshot6.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/poreshot6.png)

The function `printFlag` takes two parameters:

1. **`param_1` (of type `long`)**:
    - Represents the memory address of an array(our flag) of size `8 bytes` The function uses this address to access and manipulate the encoded data for decoding and printing.
2. **`param_2` (of type `int`)**:
    - Specifies the number of elements in the array to process.

Together, these parameters allow the function to decode and print data stored in a memory block, treating each element as an encoded value to be broken down into individual characters.

Let’s check with GDB

![investigate.webp](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/investigate.webp)

### GDB’s take:

I opened the file in gdb and set a breakpoint at the main function.

Running the program and disassembling the main function:

![poreshot5.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/poreshot5.png)

Seems there is a flag stored at address `0x555555558040`. 

I noticed the program has a condition that stops the `printflag` function from being executed. Specifically, there is a comparison operation between the values `0` and `1`. If these values are found to be unequal, the program jumps to the memory address `main+41`, bypassing the call to `printFlag`.

The comparison instruction (`cmp DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4], 0x1`) checks whether the value stored at `[rbp-0x4]` is equal to `1`. However, `[rbp-0x4]` is set to `0`, so the condition always evaluates as false. 

Thus, the program never proceeds to execute `printFlag`.

Using the `layout asm` I jumped around addresses looking at the contents of the addresses.

![poresshot.png](/assets/img/posts/ctf/perfectrootctf/poresshot.png)

We will use gdb's `call` command to directly execute the `printFlag` function from its starting point.

When invoking `printFlag` in gdb, it’s necessary to cast the function to a `void` return type. This ensures gdb handles the call correctly since it doesn’t know how to deal with functions that return `void`, and the cast avoids potential errors.

Additionally, remember to provide the required two arguments(as we saw with ghidra) to the function: 

the address of the flag (`0x555555558040`) and `8`, which specifies the number of 8-byte blocks the data contains.

Big thanks to my team mate [here](https://jnmunene.com/) for a little help.

Till next time, cheers!

And remember, there are many ways of killing a rat!
